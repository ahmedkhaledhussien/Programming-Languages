    <h1> => What is a programming language?</h1>

    <p><b><u><big>Programming languages fall into two different classifications — low-level and high-level.</big></u></b><br><br>

        <b>Low-level programming languages :</b> are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand than 1s and 0s). The benefit of low-level languages is that they’re fast and offer precise control over how the computer will function.<br><br>
        
        <b>High-level programming languages :</b> are closer to how humans communicate. High-level languages use words (like object, order, run, class, request, etc.) that are closer to the words we use in our everyday lives. This means they’re easier to program in than low-level programming languages, although they do take more time to translate into machine code for the computer.<br><br>
        
        <strong>The good news?</strong> As computers have become more powerful, the difference in runtime between low-level and high-level programming languages is often only milliseconds. As a result, high-level languages do the trick in most scenarios.</p>
